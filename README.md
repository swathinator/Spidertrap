## Spidertrap
- In a terminal, obtain your IP and cd into  ```cd /opt/spidertrap```
- Start spidertrap
<pre>python3 spidertrap.py</pre>
- Visit ```http://{YOUR LINUX IP}:8000```
- This shows random links that lead to more links in an infinite loop, but right now it all looks like gibberish. <br><br>

## Feeding a directory list
- Let's make this more realistic by adding a directory list. This file contains a large list of common directory names, file names, and paths that web crawlers typically try to access on a website:
<pre>python3 spidertrap.py directory-list-2.3-big.txt</pre>
- Refresh the page <br>

- We're going to mirror the website locally with this command:
<pre>sudo wget -m http://127.0.0.1:8000</pre>
- Spidertrap will start crawling through the mirrored website and make HTTP requests to different paths from the directory list file until it crashes <br><br>
